I developed this app for Momentum Worldwide to streamline the report creation process for each of their diverse clients. Traditionally, while the reports follow a consistent structure, they need to be recreated for every new company they work with. This app automates that process, helping to reduce the time and effort required to generate customized reports for different clients.

How does it work?

1. First you need to input data or you can use the sample data. Then press the "Enter Data" button to generate the report after you upload the data.
   Note: The data input needs to follow the sample input when it comes to variable names and formatting or else it will not work

2. Once you press the button on the side you should be able to see a bar with all the Event IDs in the data. You can click on whichever Event ID report you would like to see.

3. On the start page, you can also customize the colors and change the logo so it fits the colors of whichever company you like. After uploading an image, it will also add the Momentum logo on the bottom. There is also a background remover option that removes the background of whichever logo you upload.
   
4. You can also modify the benchmark numbers for each Event ID and it will automatically make the changes to the report
